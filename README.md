# 💯 100 Days of DSA Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of DSA** journey! 🚀

This repository is a personal commitment to improve my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** by solving problems consistently over the next **100 days**. Each day, I will upload code, notes, or problem solutions that reflect what I’ve learned or practiced.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Strengthen my fundamentals in Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Build a consistent coding habit.
- Prepare for technical interviews and problem-solving rounds.
- Track my progress publicly using GitHub commits.

---

## 📁 Structure

- Daily folders/files (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`, etc.) with:
  - Problem statements
  - Code solutions (in C++, JavaScript, or other languages I use)
  - Brief explanations or notes (if needed)

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is **not a professional project** or open-source library.  
It’s simply my personal **learning log** and **practice space**.  
Please note:

- I’m not aiming for contributions or pull requests from others.
- The code and solutions here are based on my current learning and may not always follow the best or most optimized approach.
- Feel free to explore or fork if it helps you, but this is primarily for **my growth and tracking**.
